SSH
Host: iad1-shared-e1-11.dreamhost.com
Username: dh_ryva8c
password: vu_project_ftp_2024
Port: 22

ssh dh_ryva8c@iad1-shared-e1-11.dreamhost.com

DB Credentials:
DB name: vu_project_localhost_com
Host: mysql.vu.project.wpvisions.com
Username: vu_project_ejaz
Password: vu_project_ejaz@2024

------------

Your database "vu_project_wpvisions_com" has been created!

Your hostname "mysql.vu.project.wpvisions.com" will be set up within about 5-10 minutes.
You MUST always use your hostname to connect to your database... "localhost" WILL NOT WORK.

Connect to your new database from the command line with:
mysql -u vu_project_ejaz -p -h mysql.vu.project.wpvisions.com vu_project_wpvisions_com
You can also go to http://mysql.vu.project.wpvisions.com/ to manage your MySQL database from the web (once the hostname is set up of course).
